description: Unit testing your network devices is one of the fundamental building blocks to CI/CD for networking. In this lesson, we'll explore the use of an open source tool - JSNAPy - for doing just this with Junos devices.

  # Planned stages:
  #
  # 0. (done) Quick overview of snapshots and tests. Basic example that gets you to something useful.
  # 1. Deeper-dive into retrieving data. The various ways you can do this (RPC, CLI) (not everything has a dedicated RPC, but everything in Junos is XML. Also state vs config?
  #
  #     - config, or command-line options? do we need a config file for even simple snapshots?
  #
  # 2. Deeper-drive into tests. All of the operators, etc.
  #
  #     - xpath to show a specific node? And then make an assertion about that? Like ensuring that specific OSPF neighbors are present.
  #
  # 3. Using JSNAPy with Python
  # 4. Misc JSNAPy features like sqlite, email, etc? (this one is tentative, depends on if this is interesting after the first four)
