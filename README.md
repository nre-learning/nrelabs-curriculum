# Antidote

Antidote is a project for making learning automation easier, by providing a fully in-browser learning experience, highly extensible lesson model, all back-ended by real, non simulated endpoints like network devices and servers.

The [Antidote documentation](https://antidoteproject.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) is your one-stop shop for details about Antidote. However, it's helpful to know at a high-level that Antidote isn't just one application, but a series of applications designed to work together to provide this learning experience. Here are a few other repositories you might be interested in:

- [antidote-web](https://github.com/nre-learning/antidote-web) is the front-end application for Antidote.
- [syringe](https://github.com/nre-learning/syringe) handles back-end orchestration, APIs, and communicating with Kubernetes.
- [antidote-selfmedicate](https://github.com/nre-learning/antidote-selfmedicate) is where you want to go to spin up a local instance of Antidote on your laptop.
