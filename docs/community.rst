Community Resources
===================

We're truly interested in building a community around both the Antidote platform, as well as the NRE Labs curriculum.
To that end, we've created several diverse resources for getting involved with the project.

Github
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Everything we produce in the Antidote project is on Github underneath the `nre-learning <https://github.com/nre-learning>`_
organization. Underneath that organization, you'll find all kinds of repositories, including the platform software,
operational tooling, blogs, and more.

While there is no single repository that hosts everything, the canonically "main" repository is probably the
`Antidote repo <https://github.com/nre-learning/antidote>`_. Most subcomponents of the Antidote project
are hosted in their own dedicated repositories, but this will be a good starting point, as the README
does contain references to other repositories you may also want to know about.

Finally, all project planning related to the Antidote platform, such as for subcomponents like ``syringe``
and ``antidote-web`` are done in `Github projects <https://github.com/orgs/nre-learning/projects>`_. Generally
while we're working on a release, we'll open up a new project for that release, and all current status for that
release can be found within that project. So, if you're looking for a status on current development efforts,
this is where you want to go.

Twitter
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Follow `@NRELabs <https://twitter.com/nrelabs>`_ on twitter for periodic updates on NRE Labs and the underlying platform.

Discord Channel
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
We use Discord for chat and audio/video collaboration. You can think of it like Slack, but even better, because it's
more purpose-built for some of things we want to do in the future with NRE Labs, and the authentication story is a
bit better. :)

Join our Discord channel via `this link <https://discord.gg/fRuSUyD>`_.

Mailing List
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
For those that prefer email for communication, we have two mailing lists:

- `Developers <https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/nre-labs-developers>`_
- `Users <https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/nre-labs-users>`_

Weekly Livestreams and Other Videos
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
We run a weekly livestream on Twitch at 10AM Pacific Time. Right now this is fairly informal - some weeks we might dive
deep into a topic, other weeks we might just casually chat about what's next on the project plan.

Check out our `Twitch channel <https://twitch.tv/nrelabs>`_ to watch live, and interact with us in the chat. Ask questions or
provide feedback to us live, and we might talk about it on stream!

If you can't join live, check out our `YouTube channel <https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCbfZq3sDGx6gmv7KRrhRh4g>`_, where we post the
recordings for all our streams, as well as all other video content.

Blog
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The `Network Reliability Engineering blog <https://networkreliability.engineering/post/>`_ is where we like to write about NRE concepts
and any big changes to NRE Labs. You may also be interested to know that this blog is powered by Hugo, and
`maintained in Github <https://github.com/nre-learning/nre-blog>`_, so if you want to write a guest post by opening a pull request
to that repo, we'd love to have you!


Trello Board
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
For slightly less technical project planning around the Antidote community, see our `Trello Board <https://trello.com/b/QdT69weT/nre-labs>`_.
This is where we plan anything that doesn't fit neatly into a platform release plan, which we manage in Github projects.
